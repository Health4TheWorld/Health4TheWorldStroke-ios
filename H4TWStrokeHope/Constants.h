It has been created by Health4TheWorld which is a non profit organization inspired by the unmet medical needs worldwide. The mission of the organization is solving health inequities through innovation & technology and bringing smiles around the world. Please learn more about us at health4theworld.org."
#define ABOUT_US_PARAGRAPH_TWO @"With an estimated incidence of 16.9 million and a prevalence of 33 million according to the World Health Organization, stroke is a dominant diseased entity in the category of cardiovascular diseases, and is a leading cause of serious long-term disability. The global burden of stroke falls disproportionately on low and middle-income countries, prompting us to improve global health educational outreach. We hope that this stroke educational app will be helpful."
#define ABOUT_US_PARAGRAPH_THREE @"The app has several features that we hope you will find useful!"

#define APP_FEATURE_ONE @"Stroke Educational Content – Information on causes and risk factors of stroke with guidelines from the American Stroke Association, American Heart Association, evidence based articles and other healthcare sources. It is good to remember that these are general educational tips and not recommendations for clinical care. Both the patient and trained health professionals should sit together to work on a personalized prevention regimen for stroke."
#define APP_FEATURE_TWO @"Video Animation and Exercise Tips for Stroke Recovery –Education for exercise and rehabilitation after stroke has been summarized by Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation experts from Stanford, University of California, San Francisco and University of Southern California. The exercises here are general and are intended to serve as educational guide not as medical advice.  These should be done with an occupational therapist and/or physical therapist, which can help with the correct technique and designing a regimen that will benefit a stroke patient best. A caregiver should always be present to help. These are divided into strengthening, stretching and functional mobility. Please advise your patients about the correct technique, frequency and regimen of these exercises."
#define APP_FEATURE_THREE @"Reminders for Medications and Appointments: Medication and Appointment compliance is a major issue and this tool is hopefully helpful!  Please set reminders for your patients if possible."
#define APP_FEATURE_FOUR @"Speech Strategies After Stroke: The press button voice output can help with very basic communication. The aim is to translate these to different languages so health professions and patients in remote parts of the world who lack health access can benefit from these."
