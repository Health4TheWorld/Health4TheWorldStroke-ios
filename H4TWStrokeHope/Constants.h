#define ABOUT_US_PARAGRAPH_TWO @"With an estimated incidence of 16.9 million and a prevalence of 33 million according to the World Health Organization, stroke is a dominant diseased entity in the category of cardiovascular diseases, and is a leading cause of serious long-term disability. The global burden of stroke falls disproportionately on low and middle-income countries, prompting us to improve global health educational outreach. We hope that this stroke educational app will be helpful."
